# Aru's Blog

## Project Description

**Overview:**  
Aru's Blog is a web-based platform designed to share my personal journey, insights, and experiences with the world. The blog revolves around the idea of capturing my academic and social life as an NYU student.

**Concept and Theme:**  
The primary concept and theme of this blog are to provide a glimpse into my life, interests, and adventures. It combines elements of travel, academics, lifestyle, and more to create an engaging and informative experience for readers. The goal is to inspire, educate, and connect with like-minded individuals.

**Experience:**  
I aimed to create a user-friendly and visually appealing blog that would invite readers to explore my world. Through a combination of text, images, and possibly videos, I wanted to convey my experiences authentically and offer valuable content. The design and layout were chosen to reflect my personality and style while maintaining readability and accessibility.

## Process

**Implementation:**  
The project was implemented using a combination of web technologies:

- **Wireframing:** To plan the layout and design of the blog, I started with wireframing. I created wireframes using an online tool MockFlow, which helped me visualize the structure of the blog, the placement of elements, and the overall user experience.

- **HTML/CSS:** The structure and styling of the blog were crafted using HTML and CSS to ensure a visually appealing and responsive layout.

- **JavaScript:** JavaScript was used to add interactivity to the blog, such as  like/dislike buttons and comment sections.

- **Content Creation:** The process involved creating and organizing content, including writing a blog post and editing video. The design phase focused on creating an intuitive user interface, optimizing the page for the desktop.

## Reflection/Evaluation

**Initial Expectations:**  
When I embarked on this project, my primary goal was to develop my web development skills and grow as a content creator. I also wanted to create a platform where I could share my experiences, connect with teenagers and younger audience, and potentially inspire them.

**Outcome:**  
Reflecting on the project's completion, I feel a sense of accomplishment. Since this is my first experience in web development and tools as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the project is still at its early stages of development and the codes, design and content need more changes and advancements. However, at this stage, I think the blog successfully captures my intended theme and provides a space for self-expression. 

**Challenges and Learnings:**  
Throughout this project, I encountered challenges related to design choices, technical issues, and content creation. The biggest challenge was learning HTML, CSS JavaScripts tools in a short period of time while already creating the web page. However, these challenges also provided valuable learning opportunities and lots of practice. I gained basic skills in HTML/CSS and gained insights into content creation and web hosting.

**Future Plans:**  
In the future, I plan to continue expanding my knowledge in wev development and improving the blog. The project has many flaws which should be addressed, such as optimizing the page for mobile or  I'll seek feedback from readers to enhance the user experience and provide even more valuable content.
